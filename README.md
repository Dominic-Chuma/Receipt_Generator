# Receipt_Generator

This is a django project tat produces PDF files of a particular user of interest, based on their ID.

The API test and documentation of this app was done with djangorest framework.
Url:- 127.0.0.1/heroes

I began work on saturday as I wasn't disposed based on my current job and I am delivering this on Monday.

Amidst everything, I tried to get it to the public on heroku and even shared hosting (battling with it for the past 24hrs) but it was to no avail due to incompatibility issues with the cloud platform and some dependencies like "reportlab" (which is the actual PDF creating dependency).

With all this annoying excuse that you probably do not want to hear, I decided to submit this on 72 hr mark given (beginning from saturday when I started...)

You can fork or download the code with all the dependencies in the "requirements.txt" file locally for you confirm it works.

Thank for your time and for this opportunity
